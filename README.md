- Use technical terminologyand assume prior knowledge for expert audience.
  
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
- Conducting surveys or interviews to understand audience background and expertise.
- Analyzing industry reports or research studies,to understand common language gaps.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
- Use pain language and avoid jargon.

## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
- Diagrams to illustrate system architecture.
- Flowcharts to illustrate decision making processes.
- Charts and graphs to illustrate data trends and patterns.
